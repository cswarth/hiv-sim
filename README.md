Inference of ancestral sequences from simulated HIV transmissions

How detailed can we get?  Are all mutations assumed to be productive,
or do we have a selection criteria that is useful?

Scripts here (so far) are useful for assembling XML config files for
SANTA and for BEAST.  For santa, they can construct config files that
sample sequences from earlier runs, simulating a transmission event.
For beast, they are useful for inserting simulated sequences into
template config files for geneological inference.
