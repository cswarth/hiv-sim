HIV-1 evolution was simulated for 50,000 generations, sampling 100 sequences from each generation.

From this single evolutionary lineage, two generations were
 sampled to simulate a transmission hierarchy.
 For example, 10 sequences were selected from generation 400, and 10
 sequences were selected from generation 1000.  These sequences were
 grouped into a mono-phyletic taxa, forming two main branches for a
 phylogenetic tree. BEAST was used to infer sequences at the root of
 this tree.

 One branch was kept constant, selected from generation 400, while
 the other branch was selected from generations, 100, 500, 1000, and
 10,0000 of the simulated lineage.  These datasets were used to infer ancestral sequeces for strict and relaxed molecular clock models, resulting in eight BEAST runs in total.
