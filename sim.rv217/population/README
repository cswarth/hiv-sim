Explore the effect of different simulated population sizes on the
quality of founder inference.  Note that the poulation being sized in
that of the SANTA simulation, not of the effective population in
Beast.

A plot showing the effect of simulated population sizeon ffounder inference is in population.png.
To reconstruct this plot,

   $ scons
   $ processdata.r
   $ mkplot.r

The 'scons' command will run the simulation and performa founder
inference using beast and prank.  'processdata.r' will calculate
distance from inferred founder to actual founder for all the simulated
results.  'mkplot.r' will plrot the results and create a .png file.
